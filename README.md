[View the live project here.](https://msierag.github.io/It-sil-heve/)

## Purpose of the website

This is a website for a simple quiz game about the Dutch Elfstedentocht (transl. "Eleven Cities Tour"), a long distance skating event on natural ice. Every time there is a prolonged period of frost, Dutch people anxiously await the decision whether this will be the year there will finally be another Elfstedentocht. The last event took place in early 1997. This year (2021) we came close, but due to the ongoing pandemic it was regretfully decided not to hold the race (which didn't stop individual citizens from skating the route on their own though). 

The purpose of this website is to provide the skating community with a quiz game as entertainment while they wait for the next Elfstedentocht. It is intended to bring the event to the attention of people outside the Dutch skating community. The name "It sil heve" was chosen because the words are synonymous with the Elfstedentocht anticipation. They are Frisian and mean "It will happen", they were used to announce the 1985 event and are also displayed on the Elfstedentoch monument. The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential users.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### Visiting User Goals

        1. As a visiting user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site. 
        2. As a visiting user, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
        3. As a visiting user, I want to know my position in the game.
        4. As a visiting user, I want to compete.
        
-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   There are eight colours used throughout the site, the first two are main colours and the remaining six are used for accents.
        ##### Main colours
           ![Coolors rendering of main colour scheme](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/maincolours.png?raw=true)
            
            The colours #41464b and #a1b8d6 were chosen as they approach the palette of the background image on the index.html. The colours are cool to approach the colours seen in the landscape on a Dutch winter day, but with enough gray to not become too harsh when viewed on a screen.
        ##### Accent colours
           ![Coolors rendering of effect colourscheme](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/effectcolours.png?raw=true)
            
            The colours #3b4044, #3accf, #6e91bf, #90ee90 and #ffb6c1 are accent colours. The first two are used in hover effects and box-shadows. #6e91bf is used on the game.html page to better set apart the answer-prefix. The last two colours are also used on the game.html to indicate whether the correct or incorrect answer has been selected. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Raleway font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Raleway was chosen as it is an elegant sans-serif typeface family.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The large background image on the index.html is representative of long-distance skating on natural ice in the Netherlands: large, open space with a few people. It provides a very serene scene, which was used as the guiding sense for the rest of the project.

## Testing

### Validation 

The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator Services and JSHint were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 
    - Home - [Result](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/homehtml.png?raw=true)
    - Game - [Result](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/gamehtml.png?raw=true)
    - Endgame - [Result](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/endgamehtml.png?raw=true)
    - Scoreboard - [Result](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/scoreboardhtml.png?raw=true)

    No errors or warnings were given for the HTML code.
    
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 

    One error and one warning were given for the CSS code - [Results](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/cssbefore.png?raw=true)
    The error referred to the fact that for the hover effect on the buttons transform: scale(0.3rem) was used. Rem is not allowed as a value for transform. Correcting this to transform: scale(1.3) resolved the error.
    
    The warning referred to the fact that the W3C CSS Validator cannot check linked/imported files in direct input. Style.css has an import link for the Google Font of 'Raleway' and the link to the background image for the home page. This seems to be a minor issue inherent to the way the validator is set up, but as it doesn't impact the function of the site I've decided to leave it as is. - [Results](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/cssafter.png?raw=true)  

-  [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)     
    The linter gave no fatal errors, only warnings. Most of these pertained to the fact that the syntax used is only available in ES6. As the code also doesn't produce any errors in ChromeDevTools I desiced to leave the code as it is. 
    
    Script.js - [Results](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/scriptjs.png?raw=true) 
    
    Endgame.js - [Results](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/endgamejs.png?raw=true)
    
    Scoreboard.js - [Results](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/validation/scoreboardjs.png?raw=true) 

### Google Lighthouse

I used Google Lighthouse to audit the site's performance, accessibility, use of best practices and search engine optimization.

Testing resulted in the following [score](https://github.com/MSierag/It-sil-heve/blob/master/assets/images/testing/lighthouse/lighthouse.png?raw=true):
-   Performance: 98%
-   Accessibility: 100%
-   Best Practices: 100%
-   SEO: 100%

**Performance** - Two suggested improvements involved removing or altering CSS and JavaScript elements which are included in Bootstrap. I decided against tampering with this. 

### Responsiveness testing

To test the responsiveness of the site [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) were used. 
Screenshots for the home page and the game page are included. The end game and scoreboard pages with their minimal content followed the same line as the other two pages.

#### Conclusions
Only on the smallest smartphone screen (320x480) did the background image interfere with the text on the buttons.  [Screensizemap](https://screensizemap.com/) was consulted to determine the popularity of this screen size.
The popularity listed for this type of screen hovers around 2% and seems to concern smartphones which can be considered at the end of their lifecycle. 
It is listed as a known issue.
